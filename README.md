# MyReads App

First project for Udacity's React Nanodegree program. This bookshelf app allows you to search for, select, and place books on three different shelves: currently reading, want to read, or read. 

Live version: https://mybooks-app.herokuapp.com/

## How to Use the App
* The main page displays three bookshelves which separate selected books into categories: currently reading, want to read, and read. 
* To change a book's category or remove a book from the list, click the round button at the lower right corner of the book's cover.
* To add a book to the shelves, click on the round + button at the bottom of the page and enter an author's name or subject.
* Note: The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). The terms listed are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend.

## Installation

To install the dependencies needed for this project and start the server, run these two commands in the console:

* `npm install`
* `npm start`

## Create React App
