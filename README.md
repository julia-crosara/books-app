# MyReads React App

First project for Udacity's React Nanodegree program. This bookshelf app allows you to search for, select, and categorize books you are currently reading, want to read, or have already read. 

Live version: https://mybooks-app.herokuapp.com/

## How to Use the App

* Books are sorted into three categories: Currently Reading, Want to Read, and Read
* To change a book's category or remove a book from the list, click the round button at the lower right corner of the book's cover.
* To add a book to the shelves, click on the round + button at the bottom of the page and enter an author's name or subject.
* Note: The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend.

## Installation

To install the dependencies needed for this project and start the server, run these two commands in the console:

* `npm install`
* `npm start`

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
