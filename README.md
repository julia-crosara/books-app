# MyBooks App

This bookshelf app allows you to search for, select, and place books on three different shelves: currently reading, want to read, or read. Created for Udacity's React Developer Nanodegree.

## How to Use the App
* The main page displays three bookshelves which separate books into categories: currently reading, want to read, and read. 
* To change a book's category or remove it from a shelf, click the round button at the lower right corner of the book's cover.
* To add a book to the shelves, click on the round + button at the bottom of the page and enter an author name or subject into the search field. Select the book and assign it to a shelf. Return to the main page.
* Note: The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). The terms listed are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend.

## Installation
